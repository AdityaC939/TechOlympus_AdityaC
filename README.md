Pride of Jhansi — Defend the Fort

A Strategic Historical Siege Game

About This Project

Pride of Jhansi is a browser-based historical strategy game that I developed during a hackathon as part of the TechOlympus event. The game places the player in the year March 1858, during the siege of Jhansi Fort, where the legendary Rani Lakshmibai and her defenders faced the forces of the British East India Company. The core experience is a mix of strategic decision-making, resource management, and continuous tactical defense against relentless enemy pressure.

My goal was to create a game that is both accessible and engaging — something that players can understand quickly but that also has depth, meaningful choices, and replay value. I wanted this project to be both a technical exercise and a narrative tribute to a significant moment in Indian history.

Gameplay Overview

In Pride of Jhansi, you take on the role of the commander defending Jhansi’s walls. There are no discrete “waves” in the classic sense — instead, pressure steadily increases as enemy forces advance toward the fort. You place defenders, manage scarcity of supplies, and make impactful decisions within the flow of the siege.

Key gameplay elements include:

Continuous Assault System

Enemies approach continuously, creating an ever-building sense of tension.

There is no pause between waves — the challenge flows in real time.

Tactical Placement

You select and place different defender units on the battlefield.

Choices matter because resources are limited.

Decision Moments

At certain points, you are presented with decisions such as:

Should resources be used now or saved for later?

Should civilians be evacuated or defenses reinforced?

Should Rani Lakshmibai personally lead a charge?

These decisions significantly influence how long you can defend and which ending you reach.

Hero Unit: Rani Lakshmibai

Rani is a powerful unit on the battlefield.

However, her safety is paramount: if she falls, it results in defeat.

Multiple Endings

Your choices and performance lead to different outcomes, such as:

An honorable retreat

A heroic last stand

A near-miraculous defense

This encourages replaying the game to explore alternate strategies and endings.

Technical Details
Stack & Tools Used

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the foundation of the project.

Game rendering and interaction logic are handled using basic DOM manipulation and Canvas concepts.

The project was initially scaffolded using Lovable (a no-code/low-code UI tool), then migrated to a more traditional code workflow for customization and control.

I deployed the game using Netlify, which hosts the built game so it can be played in a browser without additional setup.

How to Play / Run Locally

If you want to run this game on your own machine or build on it:

cd TechOlympus_AdityaC


Install dependencies (if any)
(If the project uses npm/vite, otherwise skip)

npm install


Start the local server

npm run dev


Open your browser
Visit http://localhost:3000 (or the console-reported address) to play the game.

Design Philosophy

I approached this project with several priorities:

Accessible Gameplay

I wanted people unfamiliar with strategy games to feel comfortable within the first minute of play. Rather than complex menus or huge list of units, the game has just enough depth to make decisions meaningful.

Historical Respect

The story and choices are grounded in the real emotional and strategic weight faced during the siege of Jhansi. The game isn’t just about defeating enemies — it’s about choices under pressure and their consequences.

Scalability

Although this version is a prototype, the design allows for future enhancements such as:

More enemy types

Expanded historical context

Alternate difficulty modes

Audio effects and music

Challenges & What I Learned

Building this game taught me a lot:

How to manage continuous game loops without discrete wave breaks

Creating UI that balances gameplay information without clutter

Integrating narrative decision moments with real-time mechanics

Deploying a web game for public play via Netlify

This project pushed me to think about both technical implementation and player experience holistically.

Future Plans

Here are some ideas I want to explore next:

Add optional tutorial guidance for first-time players

Improve visuals and animations using sprite assets

Add audio feedback (ambient sounds, unit sounds)

Introduce a scoring leaderboard

Implement keyboard controls for accessibility
